The application was created for the recruitment process for an internship at OCADO.
The program reads data from Json files, saves the relevant information in objects,
 performs the necessary operations and creates schedules for packing orders.
The IntelliJ IDEA environment and the Maven software automation tool were used for the work.
The application was tested manually by typing source path of the files in the console.
After starting the program, it will ask for pecifying the correct file paths.
